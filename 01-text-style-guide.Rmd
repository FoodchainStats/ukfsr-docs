## UKFSR specific guidance

Some of this may replicate the GDS advice.


### Spelling/Word choice 

 - Say “UKFSR” or “this report”, not “the Report”. 

 - Use ‘coronavirus (COVID-19)’ in the text at first mention, then ‘COVID-19’ after that. 

 - government, UK government (not capitalised unless it’s Welsh or Scottish Government) 

 - other government departments  
 
 - Use ‘the’ when talking about ‘the FSA’, but don’t use ‘the’ when talking about ‘FSS’ 

 - FSA and FSS can be referred to collectively as “UK food safety bodies”, but not “food standards agencies.” 

 - Capitals when talking about ethnicities, e.g. ‘White’, ‘Black’ 

 - Disabled people and not people with disabilities
 
 - Talking about Brexit:  

     - You can use the term ‘Brexit’ to provide historical context, but it’s better to use specific dates where possible. For example, use: 

         - ‘31 December 2020’ rather than ‘Brexit’ or ‘when the UK left the EU’ 
         - ‘before 31 December 2020’ rather than ‘during the transition period’ 
         - ‘after 1 January 2021’ rather than ‘after the transition period’ 


 - Dates: do not use a comma between the month and year: 4 June 2017 

 - white paper (lower case) 

 - Be very careful with the word “affordable”. Food is more affordable if it’s cheaper relative to incomes and other factors – if the price has gone down (but other factors mean it’s harder to afford) it’s simply _cheaper_. The general argument of the UKFSR is that over the last decade food *has got cheaper, but not more affordable* – so check this! 
 
 - Words to avoid:  

    - Robust 
    - Overarching 
    - Strengthen (unless we are actually strengthening an architectural structure) 
    - Tackling  
    - Going forward 
    - In order to (superfluous, never use it) 
    - impact (do not use this as a synonym for have an effect on, or influence) 
    - facilitate (instead, say something specific about how you’re helping) 
    - focusing 
    - key (unless it unlocks something. A subject/thing is not key - it’s probably important) 
    
### References

Include a reference in-text after the relevant sentence/paragraph. References should follow the style guide. When writing a reference:

 - do not use italics 
 - use single quote marks around titles 
 - write out abbreviations in full: page not p, Nutrition Journal not Nutr J. 
 - use plain English, for example use ‘and others’ not ‘et al’ 
 - do not use full stops after initials or at the end of the reference 
 
*References can also be included as footnotes, particularly where too long or unwieldy for convenience in text.* 

If the reference is available online, make the title a link and include the date you accessed the online version. For example:  

 - Although food availability is increasing in low and middle-income countries, fruit and vegetables are still high-value items, meaning fats and sweeteners will make up large parts of the increase in consumption (FAO. [‘OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook 2021-2030’](https://www.fao.org/3/cb5332en/cb5332en.pdf) 2021).  

 - There is a recurring reference through multiple themes to AUK, check for consistency to make sure it is referenced as follows: (Defra. [‘Agriculture in the United Kingdom 2020’](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1056618/AUK2020_22feb22.pdf) 2020)  

 - Example given on gov.uk: Corallo AN and others. [‘A systematic review of medical practice variation in OECD countries’](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/health-policy) Health Policy 2014: volume 114, pages 5 to 14. 
 
### General

#### Acronyms

 - Write out acronym for the first time in each theme, put abbreviation in brackets, then use abbreviation going forwards. This means acronyms should be re-introduced anew between the introduction and themes.
 
#### Labelling data

 - Each data set (table, bar chart, etc.) should be labelled as ‘Figure’ with the corresponding indicator number and a letter. For instance, for data in theme 1, this could look like ‘Figure 1.1.2a’, Figure ‘1.1.2b’, etc.
 
#### Headings

Each indicator should have the following headings (check for consistent spelling): 

 - **Headline** 
   - Brief summary of the key findings in the indicator – seen from a “what this means for food security lens” (ie, ‘the UK produces around 80% of the wheat it consumes; average production is stable with some fluctuations due to weather’ rather than ‘the UK produces x million tons of wheat’) 



 - **Context and Rationale**
   - Background information for the data and explanation why this data matters for UK food security 


 - **Data and Assessment**
 
   - Data and source 
      - If multiple sources, list as follows:  
      - Source: FSA; FSS 
   - Description of what the data in the ‘Data and Assessment’ section is showing 


 - **Rating and Trends / Direction of Travel**
   - State any visible trends in the data: ie, things appear to be stable, or to fluctuate, or have a clear positive upward/downward trend, or it’s not clear from available data. Note also any important external factors. 
   
#### The 'Voice'

 - Avoid using sentences such as ‘We produce x amount of wheat’. The tone should be more neutral, i.e. write ‘The UK produces x amount of wheat’.
 
#### e.g. / i.e. / etc.  

 - **e.g.** can sometimes be read aloud as ‘egg’ by screen reading software. Instead use ‘for example’ or ‘such as’ or ‘like’ or ‘including’ - whichever works best in the specific context. 
 - **etc** can usually be avoided. Try using ‘for example’ or ‘such as’ or ‘like’ or ‘including’. Never use etc at the end of a list starting with these words. 
 - **ie** - used to clarify a sentence - is not always well understood. Try (re)writing sentences to avoid the need to use it. If that is not possible, use an alternative such as ‘meaning’ or ‘that is’. 
 

#### Symbols 

 - '&' use 'and', e.g. Context and rationale 
 - '/' use 'and', e.g 2007/2008 = 2007 and 2008 
 - '-' use 'to' (for example in dates), e.g. 2011-14 = 2011 to 2014
 
#### Numbers  

 - Write all other numbers in numerals (including 2 to 9) except where it’s part of a common expression like ‘one or two of them’ where numerals would look strange. 
 - Use a % sign for percentages: 50% 
 - Use ‘500 to 900’ and not ‘500-900’ (except in tables) 
 
#### Quotation marks:  

Use single quotes 

 - in headlines 
 - for unusual terms 
 - when referring to words 
 - when referring to publications

Use double quotes: 

 - Use double quotes in body text for direct quotations
 
#### Sentence length 

 - Do not use long sentences. Check sentences with more than 25 words to see if you can split them to make them clearer.
