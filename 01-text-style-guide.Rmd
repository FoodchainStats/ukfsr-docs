# Text content style guide {#text}

## Hierarchy of guidance

There is a [GDS style guide](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide) for all
content published on gov.uk, and this is the primary reference.  The Analysis
Function also has guidance on [accessibility and plain
English](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/making-analytical-publications-accessible/#section-3)
which complements it. This UKFSR guide is intended to capture all of the things
which are specific to the publication, or which are not covered in the other two
guide.


## Formatting and layout

### Formatting styles

Use appropriate styles in Word, particularly for *headings*. Heading styles are
critical to the structure of the web publications (see \@ref(web)), and building
the table of contents in the print version (see \@ref(print)). If you dont use
styles during drafting, its a massive horrible job to retrofit them at the end
when time is short.

**Note there is no need to worry about the specifics of formatting and the look of the text during drafting, in terms of font, colour, spacing etc. Concentrate on the content. Stick to marking text attributes such as heading level, bold, bulleted list etc. The Defra publication template and web publishing process will deal with the look of the finished product.** 


### Indicator section headings

-   **Rationale** (Theme Lead)
    -   What is the stat? Why is it included? What question is it answering? E.g. the stat is x and helps us measure y, telling us z.

    -   How does the stat link to food security?

    -   2-3 sentences, giving reader key understanding before they see the assessment.

-   **Assessment** (Analyst lead)

    -   What is the key data point and source? (Make clear to the reader what is being measured)

    -   Are there any caveats/ changes to the key data point?

    -   Explain what the data says about the state of UK food security and how this has changed or remained constant since 2021.

        -   Assessment language placeholder Jeeves/Will to work up some phrases which can be used to summarise the Assessment section (e.g., “this trends expands the risk to food security”; “the strength to food security is shown through…”)

    -   If there is something specific which can link the assessment section to the commentary section, mention it in Assessment, and develop it further in the Commentary.

    -   3-4 sentences. There will likely be 1 graph for the key statistic.

-   **Commentary** (Theme Lead / confirmed by analyst)

    -   There will likely be 2-3 graphs for the supporting statistic (consider Analyst’s capacity to produce the graphs).

    -   **Short term:** use the supporting data points to provide context to the **key** data point across a three-year period.

    -   **Long term:** use any supporting data points which are relevant to showcasing meaningful trends (or absence of trend) over the long term. Look at past data and a forward look. Climate data could be integrated into this section.

        -   This section should have a clear time element (Recommended timescale is between 1950-2050)

        -   More detail/nuance on the statistic or supporting data/risks/opportunities.

### Labelling data

-   Each data set (table, bar chart, etc.) should be labelled as ‘Figure’ with the corresponding indicator number and a letter. For instance, for data in theme 1, this could look like ‘Figure 1.1.2a’, Figure ‘1.1.2b’, etc.

### References

See 2.5 for general linking guidance. Include a reference in-text after the relevant sentence/paragraph. References should follow the style guide. When writing a reference:

-   do not use italics
-   use single quote marks around titles
-   write out abbreviations in full: page not p, Nutrition Journal not Nutr J.
-   use plain English, for example use ‘and others’ not ‘et al’
-   do not use full stops after initials or at the end of the reference

*References can also be included as footnotes, particularly where too long or unwieldy for convenience in text.*

If the reference is available online, make the title a link and include the date you accessed the online version. For example:

-   Although food availability is increasing in low and middle-income countries, fruit and vegetables are still high-value items, meaning fats and sweeteners will make up large parts of the increase in consumption (FAO. [‘OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook 2021-2030’] 2021).

-   There is a recurring reference through multiple themes to AUK, check for consistency to make sure it is referenced as follows: (Defra. [‘Agriculture in the United Kingdom 2020’] 2020)

-   Example given on gov.uk: Corallo AN and others. [‘A systematic review of medical practice variation in OECD countries’] Health Policy 2014: volume 114, pages 5 to 14.

### Evidence gaps

As an official statistics document, its not the role of the UKFSR to make
recommendations for future research. However the report reflects the current
evidence base on issues relevant to food security, and therefore it is in scope
to reference areas where there are gaps in the evidence.


### URLs/Links

See 2.6 for references to academic reports. *Link to sources, data and relevant online material liberally*, and when in doubt, link! Remember that this is not necessarily relevant to the print edition but fundamental to the online version. Todays readers expect to be able to click through to verify or explore further the data and other sources we refer to. It is fundamental to the credibility of the report.

Alongside from the principle of ‘link liberally’, is the principle of ‘link sensibly’. This simply means point to the place where a user might generally expect to go when they click. This might be a specific document/report, a summary page containing relevant content, or even the home page for an organisation. Use your judgement and put yourself in the position of an end user. Some examples:

-   **Data links:** Every chart must have a link to the downloadable dataset. See Section 4 for guidance on that. In addition all sources must be linked to. Curious users might want to explore the raw data sources beyond our curated csvs if they are happy to do so. Either way they should have a link to the owner/producers of the data so we need to add links to unedited sources. Which leads on to…

-   **Collection pages:** Most statistics and regular gov.uk publications have a ‘collection page’ which is a place to collate current and previous versions. Consider the difference between the [CPI collection page] which always shows the catalogue of recent publications, and an individual [release]. Generally the collection page is more future proof for users, unless you are making a reference to a specific edition in the UKFSR. The UKFSR has its own [collection page], although at the time of writing it only contains the UKFSR 2021 - eventually this will become an archive and repository of the most recent analysis.

-   **General links:** If there is no logical place to go, link to the organisation home page or somewhere else sensible, eg [uktradeinfo]. Keep in mind that these links need to be relevant for at least three years - in 2027 will they still take people to places that are useful? Its OK to link to time sensitive material such as dated news reports but consider whether links are persistent and will not become stale.
