# Text style guide {#text}

## Accessibility

It is a legal obligation to make sure that our content is accessible, and this
applies to written content, graphics and tables. For chart design guidance, see
Section \@ref(chart).

## Hierarchy of guidance

There is a [GDS style guide](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide) for all
content published on gov.uk, and this is the primary reference.  The Analysis
Function also has guidance on [accessibility and plain
English](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/making-analytical-publications-accessible/#section-3)
which complements it. This UKFSR guide is intended to capture all of the things
which are specific to the publication, or which are not covered in the other two
guide.


## Formatting styles

Use appropriate styles in Word, particularly for *headings*. Heading styles are
critical to the structure of the web publications (see \@ref(web)), and building
the table of contents in the print version (see \@ref(print)). If you dont use
styles during drafting, its a massive horrible job to retrofit them at the end
when time is short.

**Note there is no need to worry about the specifics of formatting and the look of the text during drafting, in terms of font, colour, spacing etc. Concentrate on the content. Stick to marking text attributes such as heading level, bold, bulleted list etc. The Defra publication template and web publishing process will deal with the look of the finished product.**
