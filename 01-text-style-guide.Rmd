# Text style guide {#text}


For chart design guidance, see Section \@ref(chart). There is a GDS style guide
for all content published on gov.uk is available
[here](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide). The UKFSR guide is intended to
complement this.

## Accessibility

It is a legal obligation to make sure that our content is accessible, and this
applies to written content, graphics and tables. The Analysis Function has
guidance on [accessibility and plain
English](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/making-analytical-publications-accessible/).

## Formatting styles

Use appropriate styles in Word, particularly for *headings*. Heading styles are critical to the structure of the web publications (see \@ref(web)), and building the table of contents in the print version (see \@ref(print)). If you dont use styles during drafting, its a massive horrible job to retrofit them at the end when time is short.

**Note there is no need to worry about the specifics of formatting and the look of the text during drafting, in terms of font, colour, spacing etc. Concentrate on the content. Stick to marking text attributes such as heading level, bold, bulleted list etc. The Defra publication template and web publishing process will deal with the look of the finished product.**
