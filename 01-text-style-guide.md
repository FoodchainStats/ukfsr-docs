### Sentence length

-   Do not use long sentences. Check sentences with more than 25 words to see if you can split them to make them clearer.

### The ‘Voice’

-   Avoid using sentences such as ‘We produce x amount of wheat’. The tone should be more neutral, i.e. write ‘The UK produces x amount of wheat’.

### e.g. / i.e. / etc.

-   **e.g.** can sometimes be read aloud as ‘egg’ by screen reading software. Instead use ‘for example’ or ‘such as’ or ‘like’ or ‘including’ - whichever works best in the specific context.
-   **etc** can usually be avoided. Try using ‘for example’ or ‘such as’ or ‘like’ or ‘including’. Never use etc at the end of a list starting with these words.
-   **ie** - used to clarify a sentence - is not always well understood. Try (re)writing sentences to avoid the need to use it. If that is not possible, use an alternative such as ‘meaning’ or ‘that is’.

### Acronyms

-   Write out acronym for the first time in each theme, put abbreviation in brackets, then use abbreviation going forwards. This means acronyms should be re-introduced anew between the introduction and themes.

-   Note that for web publishing, acronyms need a little more work (see 6.6.1). **Its a good idea to maintain a master list of all acronyms and their full descriptions** - it will help speed up the publishing preparation.

### Numbers

-   Write all other numbers in numerals (including 2 to 9) except where it’s part of a common expression like ‘one or two of them’ where numerals would look strange.
-   Use a % sign for percentages: 50%
-   Use ‘500 to 900’ and not ‘500-900’ (except in tables)

### Spelling/Word choice

-   UKFSR or “this report”, not “the Report”.

-   Use ‘coronavirus (COVID-19)’ in the text at first mention, then ‘COVID-19’ after that.

-   government, UK government (not capitalised unless it’s Welsh or Scottish Government)

-   other government departments

-   Use ‘the’ when talking about ‘the FSA’, but don’t use ‘the’ when talking about ‘FSS’

-   FSA and FSS can be referred to collectively as “UK food safety bodies”, but not “food standards agencies.”

-   Capitals when talking about ethnicities, e.g. ‘White’, ‘Black’

-   Disabled people and not people with disabilities

-   For the Ukraine War, refer to it as the “Ukraine War”, “the war in Ukraine” or “Russia-Ukraine War” or Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

-   Total Factor Productivity can be abbreviated to TFP. It’s a commonly used abbreviation

-   Production to Supply Ratio does not have a standard abbreviation, do not abbreviate

-   Instead of referring to the cost-of-living crisis, instead say that it is the “period of high inflation between 2021 and 2023”.

-   Talking about Brexit:

    -   You can use the term ‘Brexit’ to provide historical context, but it’s better to use specific dates where possible. For example, use:

        -   ‘31 December 2020’ rather than ‘Brexit’ or ‘when the UK left the EU’
        -   ‘before 31 December 2020’ rather than ‘during the transition period’
        -   ‘after 1 January 2021’ rather than ‘after the transition period’

-   Dates: do not use a comma between the month and year: 4 June 2017

-   white paper (lower case)

-   Be very careful with the word “affordable”. Food is more affordable if it’s cheaper relative to incomes and other factors – if the price has gone down (but other factors mean it’s harder to afford) it’s simply *cheaper*. The general argument of the UKFSR is that over the last decade food *has got cheaper, but not more affordable* – so check this!

### Symbols

-   ‘&’ use ‘and’, e.g. Context and rationale
-   ‘/’ use ‘and’, e.g 2007/2008 = 2007 and 2008
-   ‘-’ use ‘to’ (for example in dates), e.g. 2011-14 = 2011 to 2014

### Quotation marks:

Use single quotes

-   in headlines
-   for unusual terms
-   when referring to words
-   when referring to publications

Use double quotes:

-   Use double quotes in body text for direct quotations

### Words to avoid

-   Robust
-   Overarching
-   Strengthen (unless we are actually strengthening an architectural structure)
-   Tackling
-   Going forward
-   In order to (superfluous, never use it)
-   impact (do not use this as a synonym for have an effect on, or influence)
-   facilitate (instead, say something specific about how you’re helping)
-   focusing
-   key (unless it unlocks something. A subject/thing is not key - it’s probably important)
