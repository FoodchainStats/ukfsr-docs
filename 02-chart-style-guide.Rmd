# Chart Style Guide {#chart}

This section will cover guidance on chart design and themes. For the text
styleguide, see Chapter \@ref(text). There is general guidance on chart design
produced by the [Analysis Function](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/data-visualisation-charts/).

## Colours

The UKFSR uses the Analysis Function palette as recommended [here](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/data-visualisation-colours-in-charts/). There is an R package, `afcolours` available on CRAN, which helps with implementing the [palette](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/afcolours/).
