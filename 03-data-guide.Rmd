# Data guide

How we prepare and organise data.

## Storage

Raw data is stored in the Amazon s3 bucket `s3-ranch-054`. Storage is certified
for sensitive data (although most data should be public domain).


### Access

The bucket is accessible from across Defra (?)

```
library(aws.s3)

contents <- get_bucket_df("s3-ranch-054")

x <- aws.s3::s3read_using(FUN = readr::read_csv,
                                      bucket = "s3-ranch-054",
                                      object = "example.csv")
```

### Structure

## Format

The data underlying each chart needs to be stored in csv format. This is so we
can offer a preview link for the data alongside each chart.
