# Web publishing guidance {#web}

## Overview

The report is most likely drafted in Word, on a Sharepoint repository. This is
the most effective way to create the content in a multiuser environment, but
eventually the content needs to be converted for publication on gov.uk. This
process, as with preparing for the physical print (Section \@ref(print)) has a
resource and time overhead.

**Factor in prep for web time! (ideally 1 week) and lock the text** 

The text must be converted to
[Govspeak](https://govspeak-preview.publishing.service.gov.uk/guide), a flavour
of Markdown. Graphics must be saved as separate files and uploaded to the
publishing system. CSV files of data must also be prepared.

Web publishing for statistics is handled by a small number of people who are
accredited to use Whitehall Publisher. We are fortunate to have two publishers
in the food team. But there is an overhead.

- web team to commandeer additional resource to cover second-eyes etc process during web print conversion

## Logistics

## Converting Word documents to markdown


R code for 

```
library(rmarkdown)
pandoc_convert(input = 'FILENAME.docx',
               to="markdown_mmd",
               output = "FILENAME.md", 
               options = c("--wrap=none",
                           "--reference-links",
                           "--extract-media=./images/"))

```

## Graphics

Images must be 960 pixels wide by 640 pixels high at 72 dpi.
SVGs can be any size and do not need resizing before uploading.

## Other useful things

### Acronym markdown {#acronyms-web}

Add to end of file, each one on a new line, using the format as per the example
below. This will enable a feature of gov.uk which pops up the acronym definition
on a tooltip whenever a user hovers their mouse over the text. See
\@ref(acronyms-text) for guidance on acronyms in the text.

```
*[UKFSR]: UK Food Security Report
*[STEC O157]: Shiga toxin-producing E. coli O157
```
