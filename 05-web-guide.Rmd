# Web publishing guidance {#web}

## Overview

The report is most likely drafted in Word, on a Sharepoint repository. This is
the most effective way to create the content in a multiuser environment, but
eventually this needs to be converted for publication on gov.uk. This process,
as with preparing for the physical print (Section \@ref(print)) has a resource
and time overhead.

**Factor in prep for web time! (ideally 1 week) and lock the text** 

The text must be converted to 'Govspeak', a flavour of Markdown. Graphics must
be saved as separate files and uploaded to the publishing system. CSV files of
data must also be prepared.

Web publishing for statistics is handled by a small number of people who are
accredited to use Whitehall Publisher. We are fortunate to have two publishers
in the food team. But there is an overhead.

## Logistics

## Converting Word documents to markdown


R code for 

```
library(rmarkdown)
pandoc_convert(input = 'FILENAME.docx',
               to="markdown_mmd",
               output = "FILENAME.md", 
               options = c("--wrap=none",
                           "--reference-links",
                           "--extract-media=./images/"))

```

## Graphics

Images must be 960 pixels wide by 640 pixels high at 72 dpi.
SVGs can be any size and do not need resizing before uploading.

## Other useful things
