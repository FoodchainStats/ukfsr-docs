\chapter{About}\label{about}}

This is an experimental site for documentation and guidance relating to
producing the UKFSR. Its intended audience is mainly the production team,
present and future. The source is
\href{https://github.com/FoodchainStats/ukfsr-docs}{here}. Got suggestions for things
to add/change? Go \href{https://github.com/FoodchainStats/ukfsr-docs/issues}{here},
open a new issue and submit your comments.

\hypertarget{what-is-this-and-how-do-i-use-it}{%
\section{What is this and how do I use it?}\label{what-is-this-and-how-do-i-use-it}}

The plan is to capture everything related to UKFSR2024 production based on
lessons from UKFSR2021 which might be useful, and end up with a repository to
pick up again once UKFSR2027 is being planned.

The guidance covers the mechanics of preparing text and graphical content,
preparing for print, organisation of data and files, etc. Editorial decisions
about content to inclide are out of scope. We aim for a logical structure, but
there may be some nuggets dropped in unusual places. At the moment its a brain
dump!

\textbf{Rationale}

We are working in the open as much as we can, so this is not a Defra Sharepoint
repository but a public Github one. We know that this means its not quite so
accessible for policy professionals to edit, but we will work on this. Working
in the open doesn't mean that we are not allowed to have internal conversations.
We don't put anything in here that we are not prepared to make public - its for
future teams, to make sure we've captured all the useful info to make their
lives easier. If there are sensitive messages/lessons, we store them somewhere
else.

This approach mirrors our approach to data and the production process: we are
storing the relevant code we use to wrangle data and produce graphics in a
similar repository. Data that is not open will of course not be shared.

Being as open and reproducible as we can is one of the current ambitions for
official statistics production. This site is part of our way of trying to meet
that ambition. That does not mean we will not make necessary internal decisions
as needed - those will be recorded appropriately and documented safely
for future reference elsewhere.

\hypertarget{ukfsr-infrastructure}{%
\section{UKFSR Infrastructure}\label{ukfsr-infrastructure}}

The UKFSR is more than just a single document. It has a number of components as
part of its underlying infrastructure:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The text content (probably drafted and hosted on Sharepoint during production)
\item
  The underlying data and graphics content, hosted on an Amazon S3 bucket
\item
  The \href{https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/UKFSR2024}{code} to produce the graphics and data for preview
\item
  The \href{https://github.com/FoodchainStats/ukfsr}{\texttt{ukfsr}} R package containing miscellanous helper functions
\item
  This documentation
\end{itemize}

All of this content is combined to produce \emph{two} key outputs:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the report on \href{https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/united-kingdom-food-security-report}{gov.uk} (this is the UKFSR to all intents and purposes for the public)
\item
  the physical printed edition laid in the HoC Library (important, but a limited print run and inaccessible to all except MPs)
\end{itemize}

In addition, there may be other published outputs, such as condensed reports,
technical annexes etc, depending on individual feedback.

\hypertarget{timings-resources-and-pinch-points}{%
\section{Timings, resources and pinch points}\label{timings-resources-and-pinch-points}}

The project plan is outside of the scope of this guide. However it is worth
noting some salient features of the process.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Data cutoff:} With a diverse set of data sources and a wide ranging release calendar, it may not be possible to match the drafting process to the release of the latest data. In some cases content can be drafted with the data available at the time and updated once the latest is published. This will apply most to annual releases. In others, for example inflation, data is more frequent. In all cases, essentially a decision has to be taken on the point at which no new data will be included, and the text finalised to cover the latest data at that point.
\item
  \textbf{Content lock:} It may be an obvious point, but there needs to be a point at which the content is set and no further amendments can be made, to allow the publishing process to start. It may be a naive hope, but this needs time. And locking content means finalising SoS input etc. Web publishing is a specialist role, and there are a limited number of people who can set publications up on Whitehall Publisher. \textbf{This is a pinch point with little remediation}.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{text}{%
\chapter{Text style guide}\label{text}}

For chart design guidance, see Section \ref{chart}. There is a GDS style guide
for all content published on gov.uk is available
\href{https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide}{here}. The UKFSR guide is intended to
complement this.

\hypertarget{formatting-styles}{%
\section{Formatting styles}\label{formatting-styles}}

Use appropriate styles in Word, particularly for \emph{headings}. Heading styles are critical to the structure of the web publications (see \ref{web}), and building the table of contents in the print version (see \ref{print}). If you dont use styles during drafting, its massive horrible job to retrofit them at the end when time is short.

\textbf{Note there is no need to worry about the specifics of formatting and the look of the text during drafting, in terms of font, colour, spacing etc. Concentrate on the content. Stick to marking text attributes such as heading level, bold, italic, bulleted list etc. The Defra publication template and web publishing process will deal with the look of the finished product.}

\hypertarget{spellingword-choice}{%
\section{Spelling/Word choice}\label{spellingword-choice}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Say ``UKFSR'' or ``this report'', not ``the Report''.
\item
  Use `coronavirus (COVID-19)' in the text at first mention, then `COVID-19' after that.
\item
  government, UK government (not capitalised unless it's Welsh or Scottish Government)
\item
  other government departments
\item
  Use `the' when talking about `the FSA', but don't use `the' when talking about `FSS'
\item
  FSA and FSS can be referred to collectively as ``UK food safety bodies'', but not ``food standards agencies.''
\item
  Capitals when talking about ethnicities, e.g.~`White', `Black'
\item
  Disabled people and not people with disabilities
\item
  For the Ukraine War, refer to it as the ``Ukraine War'', ``the war in Ukraine'' or ``Russia-Ukraine War''.
\item
  Talking about Brexit:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    You can use the term `Brexit' to provide historical context, but it's better to use specific dates where possible. For example, use:

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      `31 December 2020' rather than `Brexit' or `when the UK left the EU'
    \item
      `before 31 December 2020' rather than `during the transition period'
    \item
      `after 1 January 2021' rather than `after the transition period'
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Dates: do not use a comma between the month and year: 4 June 2017
\item
  white paper (lower case)
\item
  Be very careful with the word ``affordable''. Food is more affordable if it's cheaper relative to incomes and other factors -- if the price has gone down (but other factors mean it's harder to afford) it's simply \emph{cheaper}. The general argument of the UKFSR is that over the last decade food \emph{has got cheaper, but not more affordable} -- so check this!
\item
  Words to avoid:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Robust
  \item
    Overarching
  \item
    Strengthen (unless we are actually strengthening an architectural structure)
  \item
    Tackling\\
  \item
    Going forward
  \item
    In order to (superfluous, never use it)
  \item
    impact (do not use this as a synonym for have an effect on, or influence)
  \item
    facilitate (instead, say something specific about how you're helping)
  \item
    focusing
  \item
    key (unless it unlocks something. A subject/thing is not key - it's probably important)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{sentence-length}{%
\section{Sentence length}\label{sentence-length}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Do not use long sentences. Check sentences with more than 25 words to see if you can split them to make them clearer.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{urls}{%
\section{URLs/Links}\label{urls}}

See \ref{refs} for references to academic reports. \emph{Link to sources, data and
relevant online material liberally}, and when in doubt, link! Remember that this
is not necessarily relevant to the print edition but fundamental to the online
version. Todays readers expect to be able to click through to verify or explore
further the data and other sources we refer to. It is fundamental to the
credibility of the report.

Alongside from the principle of `link liberally', is the principle of `link
sensibly'. This simply means point to the place where a user might generally
expect to go when they click. This might be a specific document/report, a
summary page containing relevant content, or even the home page for an
organisation. Use your judgement and put yourself in the position of an end
user. Some examples:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Data links:} Every chart must have a csv preview link. See Section \ref{data} for
  guidance on that. In addition all sources must be linked to. Curious users might
  want to explore the raw data sources beyond our curated csvs if they are happy
  to do so. Either way they should have a link to the owner/producers of the data
  so we need to add links to unedited sources. Which leads on to\ldots{}
\item
  \textbf{Collection pages:} Most statistics and regular gov.uk publications have a `collection page' which is a place to collate current and previous versions. Consider the difference between the \href{https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/previousReleases}{CPI collection page} which always shows the catalogue of recent publications, and an individual \href{https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/september2023}{release}. Generally the collection page is more future proof for users, unless you are making a reference to a specific edition in the UKFSR. The UKFSR has its own \href{https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/united-kingdom-food-security-report}{collection page}, although at the time of writing it only contains the UKFSR 2021 - eventually this will become an archive and repository of the most recent analysis.
\item
  \textbf{General links:} If there is no logical place to go, link to the organisation home page or somewhere else sensible, eg \href{https://www.uktradeinfo.com/trade-data/ots-custom-table/}{uktradeinfo}. Keep in mind that these links need to be relevant for at least three years - in 2027 will they still take people to places that are useful? Its OK to link to time sensitive material such as dated news reports but consider whether links are persistent and will not become stale.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{refs}{%
\section{References}\label{refs}}

See \ref{urls} for general linking guidance. Include a reference in-text after
the relevant sentence/paragraph. References should follow the style guide. When
writing a reference:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  do not use italics
\item
  use single quote marks around titles
\item
  write out abbreviations in full: page not p, Nutrition Journal not Nutr J.
\item
  use plain English, for example use `and others' not `et al'
\item
  do not use full stops after initials or at the end of the reference
\end{itemize}

\emph{References can also be included as footnotes, particularly where too long or unwieldy for convenience in text.}

If the reference is available online, make the title a link and include the date
you accessed the online version. For example:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Although food availability is increasing in low and middle-income countries, fruit and vegetables are still high-value items, meaning fats and sweeteners will make up large parts of the increase in consumption (FAO. \href{https://www.fao.org/3/cb5332en/cb5332en.pdf}{`OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook 2021-2030'} 2021).
\item
  There is a recurring reference through multiple themes to AUK, check for consistency to make sure it is referenced as follows: (Defra. \href{https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1056618/AUK2020_22feb22.pdf}{`Agriculture in the United Kingdom 2020'} 2020)
\item
  Example given on gov.uk: Corallo AN and others. \href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/health-policy}{`A systematic review of medical practice variation in OECD countries'} Health Policy 2014: volume 114, pages 5 to 14.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{acronyms-text}{%
\section{Acronyms}\label{acronyms-text}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Write out acronym for the first time in each theme, put abbreviation in brackets, then use abbreviation going forwards. This means acronyms should be re-introduced anew between the introduction and themes.
\item
  Note that for web publishing, acronyms need a little more work (see \ref{acronyms-web}). \textbf{Its a good idea to maintain a master list of all acronyms and their full descriptions} - it will help speed up the publishing preparation.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{labelling-data}{%
\section{Labelling data}\label{labelling-data}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Each data set (table, bar chart, etc.) should be labelled as `Figure' with the corresponding indicator number and a letter. For instance, for data in theme 1, this could look like `Figure 1.1.2a', Figure `1.1.2b', etc.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{indicator-section-headings}{%
\section{Indicator section headings}\label{indicator-section-headings}}

Each indicator should have the following headings (check for consistent spelling):

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Headline}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Brief summary of the key findings in the indicator -- seen from a ``what this means for food security lens'' (ie, `the UK produces around 80\% of the wheat it consumes; average production is stable with some fluctuations due to weather' rather than `the UK produces x million tons of wheat')
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Context and Rationale}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Background information for the data and explanation why this data matters for UK food security
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Data and Assessment}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Data and source

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      If multiple sources, list as follows:\\
    \item
      Source: FSA; FSS
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Description of what the data in the `Data and Assessment' section is showing
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Rating and Trends / Direction of Travel}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    State any visible trends in the data: ie, things appear to be stable, or to fluctuate, or have a clear positive upward/downward trend, or it's not clear from available data. Note also any important external factors.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{the-voice}{%
\section{The `Voice'}\label{the-voice}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Avoid using sentences such as `We produce x amount of wheat'. The tone should be more neutral, i.e.~write `The UK produces x amount of wheat'.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{e.g.-i.e.-etc.}{%
\section{e.g.~/ i.e.~/ etc.}\label{e.g.-i.e.-etc.}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{e.g.} can sometimes be read aloud as `egg' by screen reading software. Instead use `for example' or `such as' or `like' or `including' - whichever works best in the specific context.
\item
  \textbf{etc} can usually be avoided. Try using `for example' or `such as' or `like' or `including'. Never use etc at the end of a list starting with these words.
\item
  \textbf{ie} - used to clarify a sentence - is not always well understood. Try (re)writing sentences to avoid the need to use it. If that is not possible, use an alternative such as `meaning' or `that is'.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{symbols}{%
\section{Symbols}\label{symbols}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  `\&' use `and', e.g.~Context and rationale
\item
  `/' use `and', e.g 2007/2008 = 2007 and 2008
\item
  `-' use `to' (for example in dates), e.g.~2011-14 = 2011 to 2014
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{numbers}{%
\section{Numbers}\label{numbers}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Write all other numbers in numerals (including 2 to 9) except where it's part of a common expression like `one or two of them' where numerals would look strange.
\item
  Use a \% sign for percentages: 50\%
\item
  Use `500 to 900' and not `500-900' (except in tables)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{quotation-marks}{%
\section{Quotation marks:}\label{quotation-marks}}

Use single quotes

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  in headlines
\item
  for unusual terms
\item
  when referring to words
\item
  when referring to publications
\end{itemize}

Use double quotes:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Use double quotes in body text for direct quotations
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{chart}{%
\chapter{Chart Style Guide}\label{chart}}

This section will cover guidance on chart design and themes. For the text
styleguide, see Section \ref{text}. There is general guidance on chart design
produced by the \href{https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/data-visualisation-charts/}{Analysis Function}.

\textbf{Please refer to Section \ref{data} on preparing data for charting and publication as preview csv data.}

\hypertarget{colours}{%
\section{Colours}\label{colours}}

The UKFSR uses the Analysis Function palette as recommended \href{https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/data-visualisation-colours-in-charts/}{here}. There is an R package, \texttt{afcolours} available on CRAN, which helps with implementing the \href{https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/afcolours/}{palette}.

There are a maximum of 6 colours available in the palette for categorical
variables. This means that an individual chart may not have more than 6 series.

\hypertarget{font}{%
\section{Font}\label{font}}

The gov.uk site uses a custom font, GDSTransport. Its preferable to ensure that
text in graphics also uses this font. Example R code below:

\begin{verbatim}
library(showtext)

font_add(family = "GDS Transport Website",
         regular = "font/GDSTransportWebsite.ttf",
         bold = "font/GDSTransportWebsite-Bold.ttf")

showtext_auto()
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{chart-context}{%
\section{Chart context}\label{chart-context}}

Each chart is accompanied by some additional features:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  CSV: the csv of the chart data is required for a preview/download link
\item
  URL to source: the default is a link to collection pages wherever possible.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{resolutionformat}{%
\section{Resolution/format}\label{resolutionformat}}

Graphics must be saved in both SVG and PNG format, as required by gov.uk and
for PDF respectively. See Section \ref{web} for more details.

\hypertarget{helpers}{%
\section{Helpers}\label{helpers}}

The \texttt{ukfsr} package contains functions to assist with preparing the report. See
{[}link to repo/docs{]} for details. There is a \texttt{theme\_ukfsr} theme for chart
styling, plus some functions to assist with saving charts and data in the S3
bucket.

Defaults like linewidth = 1.5 for series need to be specified?

\hypertarget{data}{%
\chapter{Data guide}\label{data}}

How we prepare and organise data.

\hypertarget{format}{%
\section{Format}\label{format}}

The data underlying each chart needs to be stored in csv format. This is so we
can offer a preview link for the data alongside each chart.

\textbf{GDS Transport font!!}

\hypertarget{storage}{%
\section{Storage}\label{storage}}

Raw data is stored in the Amazon S3 bucket \texttt{s3-ranch-054}. Storage is certified
for sensitive data (although most data should be public domain).

\hypertarget{access}{%
\subsection{Access}\label{access}}

The bucket is accessible from across Defra (?)

\begin{verbatim}
library(aws.s3)

contents <- get_bucket_df("s3-ranch-054")

x <- aws.s3::s3read_using(FUN = readr::read_csv,
                                      bucket = "s3-ranch-054",
                                      object = "example.csv")
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{structure}{%
\subsection{Structure}\label{structure}}

Here is the current suggested structure for the S3 bucket folders:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{(\columnwidth - 8\tabcolsep) * \real{0.0789}}

& & & csv & Contains final csv required to reproduce the graphics in R. In tidy format. \\
& & misc & & Optional folder to store random files, eg map shapefiles. \\
\end{longtable}

\hypertarget{file-naming-convention}{%
\subsection{File naming convention}\label{file-naming-convention}}

UKFSR content files must adhere to a naming convention. Supplementary files such
as raw data etc can be more fluid, although we recommend includint theme/
indicator numbers. If in doubt, err on the side of long descriptive file names -
its 3 years befoer anyone will look at these again!

\textbf{Content filename template}

\texttt{tX\_s\_nv\_description.svg/png/csv}

where:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \texttt{X} is theme number
\item
  \texttt{s} is section number
\item
  \texttt{n} is indicator number
\item
  \texttt{v} is indicator variant, eg a,b,c, etc
\item
  \texttt{description} needs to be enough to uniquely describe the content. Use \emph{snake\_case} as necessary.
\item
  \textbf{filetype} must be \texttt{csv} for data, \texttt{svg}/\texttt{png} for web/print respectively
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{code}{%
\subsection{Code}\label{code}}

The S3 bucket is not a public resource (although generally its contents need not be stored securely). But the code to produce the content is stored in a public Github repository at \url{https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/UKFSR2024}. It is crucial that the content code for graphics and related output is captured here.

The report is most likely drafted in Word, on a Sharepoint repository. This is
the most effective way to create the content in a multiuser environment, but
eventually the content needs to be converted for publication on gov.uk. This
process, as with preparing for the physical print (Section \ref{print}) has a
resource and time overhead.

\textbf{Factor in prep for web time! (ideally 1 week) and lock the text}

The text must be converted to
\href{https://govspeak-preview.publishing.service.gov.uk/guide}{Govspeak}, a flavour
of Markdown. Graphics must be saved as separate files and uploaded to the
publishing system. CSV files of data must also be prepared.

Web publishing for statistics is handled by a small number of people who are
accredited to use Whitehall Publisher. We are fortunate to have two publishers
in the food team. But there is an overhead.

\begin{itemize}

\item

\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{graphics}{%
\section{Graphics}\label{graphics}}

PNG images must be 960 pixels wide by 640 pixels high at 72 dpi.
SVGs can be any size and do not need resizing before uploading.

\hypertarget{converting-word-documents-to-markdown}{%
\section{Converting Word documents to markdown}\label{converting-word-documents-to-markdown}}

R code for

\begin{verbatim}
library(rmarkdown)
pandoc_convert(input = 'FILENAME.docx',
               to="markdown_mmd",
               output = "FILENAME.md", 
               options = c("--wrap=none",
                           "--reference-links",
                           "--extract-media=./images/"))
\end{verbatim}

this process will extract the PNG graphics from each Word document and place them in a separately created /images folder as .png files, leaving behind just the graphic title in the text, e.g.~\#\#\#\# Figure X.XX. YYYY (now formatted in Markdown by the conversion process).

\hypertarget{logistics}{%
\section{Logistics}\label{logistics}}

This should ideally be executed by the analytical lead for each theme:

Once the Word documents have been converted to a .md Markdown text format, the user should firstly check that all Word formatting (headings, etc.) has fed through correctly by highlighting text in the text file and pasting into the box within the \href{https://govspeak-preview.publishing.service.gov.uk/}{Govspeak converter and preview page} and viewing the output on the page.

Graphics handling: after Word document conversion, directly below the graphic title, add a descriptor (within square brackets) which should contain the graphic filename (with the correct nomenclature) with the inclusion now of the `.svg' suffix for replacement of the PNG files with their SVG equivalents, i.e.

{[}Image: XX.svg{]}

leaving a blank line before and after. The SVG files will have been generated using the relevant R code by each analyst. Adoption of this procedure will then correctly synchronise the eventually uploaded, finalised, .md Markdown files with the Whitehall publishing system, the publisher landing page for the report automatically displaying all graphics on the page after the bulk upload of all SVG files performed by the onduty publisher. The publisher will then insert the `XX.svg' SVG filenames manually underneath each graphic on the publisher landing page.

Check each graphic has an appropriate line about accessibility (i.e.~the so-called `alt-text') directly below each graphic title and its data source and before the links for viewing and downloading pertinent CSV file data, e.g.~\textbf{Figure XX.X description:} `Figure XX.X is a line chart that shows the amount of consumer spending in the UK on food and non-alcoholic drink, alcoholic drink (off-licence only) and for catering from 2002 to 2022'. In essence this sentence is an expansion (if necessary) of the graphic title itself.

CSV files: the current standard GOV.UK nomenclature for viewing/downloadng associated data CSV files is, for the data preview, e.g.~

\begin{verbatim}
https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/64beb60bd4051a00145a9201/foodchainanalysis-productivity-dataset_27jul2023i.csv/preview
\end{verbatim}

and for the data download, e.g.

\begin{verbatim}
https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1173363/foodchainanalysis-productivity-dataset_27jul2023i.csv
\end{verbatim}

it will be good practice to have placeholders for these two urls placed directly underneath the accessibility text, as the onduty publisher will have to insert the unique `nodes' for each graphic in the last step before submitting the report for 2i approval. Suggested format for this:

\begin{verbatim}
[View the data for this chart](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/NODE/XXX_PUBLICATION DATA.csv/preview)  

[Download the data for this chart](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/NODE/XXX_PUBLICATION DATA.csv)
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{formatting}{%
\section{Formatting}\label{formatting}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  To add external links to GOV.UK pages, use square brackets {[}{]} around the link text and round brackets () around the link URL, i.e.~\texttt{{[}LINK\ TEXT{]}(url)}. Make sure there are no spaces between the brackets or the link will not work. When linking to any Whitehall content, use the Whitehall publisher link and not the website URL. The first part of the URL \texttt{https://whitehall-admin.publishing.service.gov.uk/} should be used along with the relative path, for example: /government/admin/publications/123456 (i.e.~use relative links).
\item
  For internal document links, i.e.~for providing Markdown links to particular section headings in a publication page (known as `anchor' links, which although, by definition, present accessibility issues, in a report of this complexity are unavoidable), in order to link to a particular section, e.g.~`SECTION NAME', the following should be added to the text file, including a `stub name' that uniquely identifies a particular section:
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
**[SECTION NAME](#STUBNAME)** 
\end{verbatim}

(this will appear in bold font as the clickable `SECTION NAME' in the publication webpage text; the corresponding url being: \texttt{https://www.gov.uk/......\#STUBNAME}). Clicking the link will take the reader to the part of the webpage signified in the text file by:

\begin{verbatim}
### SECTION NAME
{:#STUBNAME}
<br/>
<br/>
\end{verbatim}

i.e.~\{:\#STUBNAME\} has to go on a new line, this is then followed by two blank line \texttt{\textless{}br/\textgreater{}} HTML codes.
\textbf{EXAMPLE:}
In a text file: `as outlined further in {[}Indicator 1.2.2{]} (\#united-kingdom-food-security-report-2021-theme1-indicator-1-2-2)' appears as `as outlined further in \texttt{{[}Indicator\ 1.2.2{]}(\#united-kingdom-food-security-report-2021-theme1-indicator-1-2-2)}' in the webpage text. Clicking the link in the latter sends the reader to: `Indicator 1.2.2 Components of global food demand growth' section in the webpage, which is also indicated on the left hand side section menu window pane of the GOV.UK webpage. The relevant part of the text file should appear in the form:

\begin{verbatim}
## Indicator 1.2.2 Components of global food demand growth 
{:#united-kingdom-food-security-report-2021-theme1-indicator-1-2-2}
<br/>
<br/>
\end{verbatim}

It is also possible to have subsections referred to with the same stub name such that clicking the visible link takes the reader to the main section where they can find the relevant subsection below this, e.g.~to define the term `Gross Value Added' under the `Glossary' section heading in the `Total Factor Productivity of the United Kingdom Food Chain' publication page \href{https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/food-chain-productivity/total-factor-productivity-of-the-united-kingdom-food-chain-2021-final-release}{Total Factor Productivity of the United Kingdom Food Chain}, the entry `In 2021, the value of {[}Gross Value Added{]} (\#tfp-glossary)' in the text file is observed on the webpage as \texttt{\textquotesingle{}In\ 2021,\ the\ value\ of\ **{[}Gross\ Value\ Added{]}(\#tfp-glossary)**}' such that `\#\#\# Gross Value Added (GVA)' appears as its own subsection heading within the glossary,

\begin{verbatim}
## Glossary
{:#tfp-glossary} 
.......
.......
.......
### Gross Value Added (GVA)
\end{verbatim}

For linking to other themes/sections in the report GOV.UK landing page, it is just a case of adding the stub to the end of the url for the report landing page (in this case the name of the stub will be generated by the publishing system and the publishing team will have sight of this; the full url can then be added to the relevant text file before final submission in much the same way as adding CSV file details), e.g.

switch to Theme 2 from Theme 1

\begin{verbatim}
https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/united-kingdom-food-security-report-2021/united-kingdom-food-security-report-2021-theme-2-uk-food-supply-sources
\end{verbatim}

switch to the Table of Contents

\begin{verbatim}
https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/united-kingdom-food-security-report-2021/united-kingdom-food-security-report-2021-contents
\end{verbatim}

switch to the Appendix

\begin{verbatim}
https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/united-kingdom-food-security-report-2021/united-kingdom-food-security-report-2021-appendix
\end{verbatim}

switch to the landing page

\begin{verbatim}
https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/united-kingdom-food-security-report-2021
\end{verbatim}

Stub names can also be used with external links to other GOV.UK publications cited within the report. They can be formatted by adding `\#' and the stub name to the external url, with all words separated by hyphens. For example, to link to the section `Capacity management', use \texttt{https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/public-services-network-psn-service-management-good-practice/service-management-good-practice\#capacity-management}.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  For email links, use `less than' (\textless) and `greater than' (\textgreater) arrows around email addresses to create links, e.g.
\end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}
<example@example.com>
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{other-useful-things}{%
\section{Other useful things}\label{other-useful-things}}

\hypertarget{acronyms-web}{%
\subsection{Acronym markdown}\label{acronyms-web}}

Add to end of file, each one on a new line, using the format as per the example
below. This will enable a feature of gov.uk which pops up the acronym definition
on a tooltip whenever a user hovers their mouse over the text. See
\ref{acronyms-text} for guidance on acronyms in the text.

\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{print}{%
\chapter{Physical print edition}\label{print}}

The logistics of print will depend on the service used to create the print
edition. For UKFSR2021 the printers needed a PDF of the final document to turn
into the final laid report.

\textbf{Factor in print publication time! (ideally 1 week) and lock the text}

Do not forget that preparing for web publishing (Section \ref{web}) is a separate and different process that also requires time and resources.

\hypertarget{final-word-version}{%
\section{Final Word version}\label{final-word-version}}

The assumption is that the final version will be contained in multiple Word files: one for each theme plus introductions, appendices, glossary, etc. Once these are finalised a master print version can be produced.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  `Lock' the content: set a deadline and get everyone out of the Sharepoint documents
\item
  copy the final section docs into a new folder: this folder is the master print content
\item
  get a copy of the Defra doc template which has a default front and back cover
\item
  check and secure an ISBN/Defra document number
\item
  check any standard copyright notice text
\item
  check other cover/back cover/inside cover text: last time there was specific wording like `laid before the HoC Library on \emph{date}' that needed to conform with protocol.
\end{itemize}

With this cover sheet insert the section docs as `subdocuments', in outline view. This allows the building of the master table of contents which covers the whole report. Insert the TOC and set up the Contents pages. Once all the content is in place, we can turn to formatting for print:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Margins: each section of the report needs to be formatted with mirror margins so that there is a larger gutter where the binding will be. Otherwise the content will get lost in the printed doc.
\item
  Page numbering: inside and outside so that they appear on the right and left hand side of the printed page. You need to set page numbers to inherit from each previous section so that they flow from 1-n and don't reset at the start of each child doc.
\item
  Pagination: this was a bit of a fiddle last time. Make sure that the content is settled (You probably want to eyeball the content for any errors with heading levels etc and fix all content snags before doing this or else you'll have to do it again). Refresh the TOC, and then go through inserting white space where necessary to ensure page breaks don't occur in unfortunate places.
\item
  URLs: We dont need to worry about URLs working in a paper document, but in a PDF we might want clickable links. \emph{This is pretty irrelevant to the final HTML publication (remember: the HTML is the publication, not some paper document!)}. Focus on maximising hyperlinks in the we b publication.
\end{itemize}

At this point the document should be ready for PDF conversion.

\hypertarget{create-pdf}{%
\section{Create PDF}\label{create-pdf}}

At this point it should be easy: export the master Word doc to PDF (PDF/A I think: check!). Worth checking accessibility even though the HTML version will be the truly accessible version. One thing worth checking: metadata. Check the author, organisation etc metadata in the word doc is what you want in the PDF version.

\hypertarget{accessibility}{%
\section{Accessibility}\label{accessibility}}

There was an unfulfilled request for a large print version last time. With a bit of luck, any MPs with such requirements will accept the HTML version as accessible, zoomable and screen reader friendly. If not, repeat the document conversion process and edit the style definitions to up the font size. I think there might be practical printing issues which mean it would have to be printed as multiple documents. UKFSR at 300 odd pages I think was approaching the limit of what perfect binding print can handle. Speak to the print supplier about these issues.

Its assumed that the report sections will be Word documents hosted on Sharepoint and edited in prallel by multiple authors. Sharepoint retains old versions, however it may be prudent to make a regular backup copy and store in a separate folder. There is also some kind of limit to the number of track changes and comments that Word can retain, which we ran up against a few times last time. Its probably wise to accept all track changes on a relatively regular basis and save the docs to simplify them. This is probably a matter of trial and error. See also Section \ref{print} on physical print which has some thoughts on file management at the end of the project.

\hypertarget{publication-deadline}{%
\subsection{Publication deadline}\label{publication-deadline}}

{[}from legal comments 11/01/2024{]}

The date you should lay the report is actually 3 years from the date of the last
report so that would be the 15 December 2024 (although note that this is a
Sunday so the last sitting day before this date would be appropriate). There is
no reason not to publish before this date if needed and it would be advisable
not to leave it to the last possible date. Section 19 of the Agriculture Act
2020 states that \textbf{a new UKFSR is required ``at least once every three years''}. We
think that the safest way to interpret this would be that each UKFSR laying
starts a three-year `clock' by which another UKFSR must be published. As the
first UKFSR was laid in Parliament on December 16 2021, the three-year clock
means that the next must be laid by December 15 2024, but can be any time
before. If UKFSR2 is instead laid on, for instance, September 1 2024, UKFSR3
will have to be laid by August 31 2027.

Also please note that although preferable, \textbf{Parliament does not absolutely have
to be sitting for a paper to be laid.} This has previously been considered by
policy and legal and whilst the UKFSR was published as an Act paper, if it must
be published on a non-sitting day in order to avoid breaching statutory duties,
Parliamentary Team consider that it could in exceptional circumstances be laid
as a Command Paper with the full knowledge of the Journal Office and with the
relevant changes made to its cover. This may not be necessary in future but for
now it is advisable.

\textbf{Further, the UKFSR is Official Statistics}, which require notice of publication
at least four weeks before the intended publication date, and publication on
that date. Once the date is pre-notified, any failure to publish on that date
will invite scrutiny from the Office of Statistical Regulation. This does not
touch on any of the other rules, but if coming out on the same day should take
account of the time it takes to lay documents in Parliament, so the next UKFSR
should probably commit to publish at noon or so rather than 0930.

\hypertarget{late-laying-of-the-report}{%
\subsubsection{Late laying of the report}\label{late-laying-of-the-report}}

If the report is laid later than deadline date there would be a breach of this
statutory duty. The risk of a legal challenge being brought (our assessment is
that there would be a low risk (less than 30\%)) would depend on the
circumstances that caused the delay and the length of the delay. However, if it
is brought the chances of successful challenge are medium-high (50-70\%) given
that there is a clear statutory duty to publish by a certain date. We could
perhaps mitigate this depending on the circumstances which would lower the risk.
For example, the Courts would likely look more favourably on SoS if the reason
for delay was an election. However, if you know there will be an election then
steps should be taken to avoid delay as much as possible. In short, unavoidable
circumstances would look more favourable to the Courts than avoidable ones.

\hypertarget{environmental-principles-policy}{%
\subsubsection{Environmental principles policy}\label{environmental-principles-policy}}

We have considered whether the Environmental principles policy would apply here. Section 17(5) of the Environment Act 2021 sets out 5 principles that ministers will need to consider when making policy, namely:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  integration principle
\item
  prevention principle
\item
  rectification at source principle
\item
  polluter pays principle
\item
  precautionary principle
\end{itemize}

Whilst any particular concerns arising from considerations in the EPP statement will likely not apply when collecting data and compiling the report, any policy development that follows on from the reports' findings should have due regard to the principles. This is just something to flag at this stage.

\hypertarget{general-considerations}{%
\subsubsection{General considerations}\label{general-considerations}}

Lastly, and as a general legal point, if the contents of the report were to be challenged, the ground would likely be rationality. It is therefore important that information sources are referenced correctly and checked. The 2021 report will of course provide an excellent starting point and seeing as that was not challenged, adopting a similar approach would be sensible.
