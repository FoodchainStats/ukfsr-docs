Its intended audience is mainly the production team, present and future. The source is here. Got suggestions for things to add/change? Go here, open a new issue and submit your comments. 1.1 What is this and how do I use it? The plan is to capture everything related to UKFSR2024 production based on lessons from UKFSR2021 which might be useful, and end up with a repository to pick up again once UKFSR2027 is being planned. The guidance covers the mechanics of preparing text and graphical content, preparing for print, organisation of data and files, etc. Editorial decisions about content to inclide are out of scope. We aim for a logical structure, but there may be some nuggets dropped in unusual places. At the moment its a brain dump! Rationale We are working in the open as much as we can, so this is not a Defra Sharepoint repository but a public Github one. We know that this means its not quite so accessible for policy professionals to edit, but we will work on this. Working in the open doesn’t mean that we are not allowed to have internal conversations. We don’t put anything in here that we are not prepared to make public - its for future teams, to make sure we’ve captured all the useful info to make their lives easier. If there are sensitive messages/lessons, we store them somewhere else. This approach mirrors our approach to data and the production process: we are storing the relevant code we use to wrangle data and produce graphics in a similar repository. Data that is not open will of course not be shared. Being as open and reproducible as we can is one of the current ambitions for official statistics production. This site is part of our way of trying to meet that ambition. That does not mean we will not make necessary internal decisions as needed - those will be recorded appropriately and documented safely for future reference elsewhere. 1.2 UKFSR Infrastructure The UKFSR is more than just a single document. It has a number of components as part of its underlying infrastructure: The text content (probably drafted and hosted on Sharepoint during production) The underlying data and graphics content, hosted on an Amazon S3 bucket The code to produce the graphics and data for preview The ukfsr R package containing miscellanous helper functions This documentation All of this content is combined to produce two key outputs: the report on gov.uk (this is the UKFSR to all intents and purposes for the public) the physical printed edition laid in the HoC Library (important, but a limited print run and inaccessible to all except MPs) In addition, there may be other published outputs, such as condensed reports, technical annexes etc, depending on individual feedback. 1.3 Timings, resources and pinch points The project plan is outside of the scope of this guide. However it is worth noting some salient features of the process. Data cutoff: With a diverse set of data sources and a wide ranging release calendar, it may not be possible to match the drafting process to the release of the latest data. In some cases content can be drafted with the data available at the time and updated once the latest is published. This will apply most to annual releases. In others, for example inflation, data is more frequent. In all cases, essentially a decision has to be taken on the point at which no new data will be included, and the text finalised to cover the latest data at that point. Content lock: It may be an obvious point, but there needs to be a point at which the content is set and no further amendments can be made, to allow the publishing process to start. It may be a naive hope, but this needs time. And locking content means finalising SoS input etc. Web publishing is a specialist role, and there are a limited number of people who can set publications up on Whitehall Publisher. This is a pinch point with little remediation.

There is a GDS style guide for all content published on gov.uk is available here. The UKFSR guide is intended to complement this. 2.1 Formatting styles Use appropriate styles in Word, particularly for headings. Heading styles are critical to the structure of the web publications (see 6), and building the table of contents in the print version (see 7). If you dont use styles during drafting, its massive horrible job to retrofit them at the end when time is short. Note there is no need to worry about the specifics of formatting and the look of the text during drafting, in terms of font, colour, spacing etc. Concentrate on the content. Stick to marking text attributes such as heading level, bold, italic, bulleted list etc. The Defra publication template and web publishing process will deal with the look of the finished product. 2.2 Spelling/Word choice Say “UKFSR” or “this report”, not “the Report”. Use ‘coronavirus (COVID-19)’ in the text at first mention, then ‘COVID-19’ after that. government, UK government (not capitalised unless it’s Welsh or Scottish Government) other government departments Use ‘the’ when talking about ‘the FSA’, but don’t use ‘the’ when talking about ‘FSS’ FSA and FSS can be referred to collectively as “UK food safety bodies”, but not “food standards agencies.” Capitals when talking about ethnicities, e.g. ‘White’, ‘Black’ Disabled people and not people with disabilities For the Ukraine War, refer to it as the “Ukraine War”, “the war in Ukraine” or “Russia-Ukraine War”. Talking about Brexit: You can use the term ‘Brexit’ to provide historical context, but it’s better to use specific dates where possible. For example, use: ‘31 December 2020’ rather than ‘Brexit’ or ‘when the UK left the EU’ ‘before 31 December 2020’ rather than ‘during the transition period’ ‘after 1 January 2021’ rather than ‘after the transition period’ Dates: do not use a comma between the month and year: 4 June 2017 white paper (lower case) Be very careful with the word “affordable”. Food is more affordable if it’s cheaper relative to incomes and other factors – if the price has gone down (but other factors mean it’s harder to afford) it’s simply cheaper. The general argument of the UKFSR is that over the last decade food has got cheaper, but not more affordable – so check this! Words to avoid: Robust Overarching Strengthen (unless we are actually strengthening an architectural structure) Tackling Going forward In order to (superfluous, never use it) impact (do not use this as a synonym for have an effect on, or influence) facilitate (instead, say something specific about how you’re helping) focusing key (unless it unlocks something. A subject/thing is not key - it’s probably important) 2.3 Sentence length Do not use long sentences. Check sentences with more than 25 words to see if you can split them to make them clearer. 2.4 URLs/Links See 2.5 for references to academic reports. Link to sources, data and relevant online material liberally, and when in doubt, link! Remember that this is not necessarily relevant to the print edition but fundamental to the online version. Todays readers expect to be able to click through to verify or explore further the data and other sources we refer to. It is fundamental to the credibility of the report. Alongside from the principle of ‘link liberally’, is the principle of ‘link sensibly’. This simply means point to the place where a user might generally expect to go when they click. This might be a specific document/report, a summary page containing relevant content, or even the home page for an organisation. Use your judgement and put yourself in the position of an end user. Some examples: Data links: Every chart must have a csv preview link. See Section 4 for guidance on that. In addition all sources must be linked to. Curious users might want to explore the raw data sources beyond our curated csvs if they are happy to do so. Either way they should have a link to the owner/producers of the data so we need to add links to unedited sources. Which leads on to… Collection pages: Most statistics and regular gov.uk publications have a ‘collection page’ which is a place to collate current and previous versions. Consider the difference between the CPI collection page which always shows the catalogue of recent publications, and an individual release. Generally the collection page is more future proof for users, unless you are making a reference to a specific edition in the UKFSR. The UKFSR has its own collection page, although at the time of writing it only contains the UKFSR 2021 - eventually this will become an archive and repository of the most recent analysis. General links: If there is no logical place to go, link to the organisation home page or somewhere else sensible, eg uktradeinfo. Keep in mind that these links need to be relevant for at least three years - in 2027 will they still take people to places that are useful? Its OK to link to time sensitive material such as dated news reports but consider whether links are persistent and will not become stale. 2.5 References See 2.4 for general linking guidance. Include a reference in-text after the relevant sentence/paragraph. References should follow the style guide. When writing a reference: do not use italics use single quote marks around titles write out abbreviations in full: page not p, Nutrition Journal not Nutr J. use plain English, for example use ‘and others’ not ‘et al’ do not use full stops after initials or at the end of the reference References can also be included as footnotes, particularly where too long or unwieldy for convenience in text. If the reference is available online, make the title a link and include the date you accessed the online version. For example: Although food availability is increasing in low and middle-income countries, fruit and vegetables are still high-value items, meaning fats and sweeteners will make up large parts of the increase in consumption (FAO. ‘OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook 2021-2030’ 2021). There is a recurring reference through multiple themes to AUK, check for consistency to make sure it is referenced as follows: (Defra. ‘Agriculture in the United Kingdom 2020’ 2020) Example given on gov.uk: Corallo AN and others. ‘A systematic review of medical practice variation in OECD countries’ Health Policy 2014: volume 114, pages 5 to 14. 2.6 Acronyms Write out acronym for the first time in each theme, put abbreviation in brackets, then use abbreviation going forwards. This means acronyms should be re-introduced anew between the introduction and themes. Note that for web publishing, acronyms need a little more work (see 6.6.1). Its a good idea to maintain a master list of all acronyms and their full descriptions - it will help speed up the publishing preparation. 2.7 Labelling data Each data set (table, bar chart, etc.) should be labelled as ‘Figure’ with the corresponding indicator number and a letter. For instance, for data in theme 1, this could look like ‘Figure 1.1.2a’, Figure ‘1.1.2b’, etc. 2.8 Indicator section headings Each indicator should have the following headings (check for consistent spelling): Headline Brief summary of the key findings in the indicator – seen from a “what this means for food security lens” (ie, ‘the UK produces around 80% of the wheat it consumes; average production is stable with some fluctuations due to weather’ rather than ‘the UK produces x million tons of wheat’) Context and Rationale Background information for the data and explanation why this data matters for UK food security Data and Assessment Data and source If multiple sources, list as follows: Source: FSA; FSS Description of what the data in the ‘Data and Assessment’ section is showing Rating and Trends / Direction of Travel State any visible trends in the data: ie, things appear to be stable, or to fluctuate, or have a clear positive upward/downward trend, or it’s not clear from available data. Note also any important external factors. 2.9 The ‘Voice’ Avoid using sentences such as ‘We produce x amount of wheat’. The tone should be more neutral, i.e. write ‘The UK produces x amount of wheat’. 2.10 e.g. / i.e. / etc. e.g. can sometimes be read aloud as ‘egg’ by screen reading software. Instead use ‘for example’ or ‘such as’ or ‘like’ or ‘including’ - whichever works best in the specific context. etc can usually be avoided. Try using ‘for example’ or ‘such as’ or ‘like’ or ‘including’. Never use etc at the end of a list starting with these words. ie - used to clarify a sentence - is not always well understood. Try (re)writing sentences to avoid the need to use it. If that is not possible, use an alternative such as ‘meaning’ or ‘that is’. 2.11 Symbols ‘&amp;’ use ‘and’, e.g. Context and rationale ‘/’ use ‘and’, e.g 2007/2008 = 2007 and 2008 ‘-’ use ‘to’ (for example in dates), e.g. 2011-14 = 2011 to 2014 2.12 Numbers Write all other numbers in numerals (including 2 to 9) except where it’s part of a common expression like ‘one or two of them’ where numerals would look strange. Use a % sign for percentages: 50% Use ‘500 to 900’ and not ‘500-900’ (except in tables) 2.13 Quotation marks: Use single quotes in headlines for unusual terms when referring to words when referring to publications Use double quotes: Use double quotes in body text for direct quotations "],["chart.html", "Section 3 Chart Style Guide 3.1 Colours 3.2 Chart context 3.3 Resolution/format 3.4 Helpers", " Section 3 Chart Style Guide This section will cover guidance on chart design and themes. For the text styleguide, see Section 2. There is general guidance on chart design produced by the Analysis Function. Please refer to Section 4 on preparing data for charting and publication as preview csv data. 3.1 Colours The UKFSR uses the Analysis Function palette as recommended here. There is an R package, afcolours available on CRAN, which helps with implementing the palette. There are a maximum of 6 colours available in the palette for categorical variables. This means that an individual chart may not have more than 6 series. 3.2 Chart context Eache chart is accompanied by some additional features: CSV: the csv of the chart data is required for a preview/download link URL to source: the default is a kink to collection pages wherever possible. 3.3 Resolution/format SVG/PNG 3.4 Helpers We need a theme_fsr theme for chart styleing. Defaults like linewidth = 1.5 for series need to be specified. We could have an fsr package a la ggfbs but is it sensible? "],["data.html", "Section 4 Data guide 4.1 Format 4.2 Storage", " Section 4 Data guide How we prepare and organise data. 4.1 Format The data underlying each chart needs to be stored in csv format. This is so we can offer a preview link for the data alongside each chart. GDS Transport font!! 4.2 Storage Raw data is stored in the Amazon S3 bucket s3-ranch-054.

In tidy format. misc Optional folder to store random files, eg map shapefiles. 4.2.3 File naming convention UKFSR content files must adhere to a naming convention. Supplementary files such as raw data etc can be more fluid, although we recommend includint theme/ indicator numbers. If in doubt, err on the side of long descriptive file names - its 3 years befoer anyone will look at these again! Content filename template TX_s_nv_description.svg/png/csv where: X is theme number s is section number n is indicator number v is indicator variant, eg a,b,c, etc description needs to be enough to uniquely describe the content. Use snake_case as necessary. filetype must be csv for data, svg/png for web/print respectively 4.2.4 Code The S3 bucket is not a public resource (although generally its contents need not be stored securely). But the code to produce the content is stored in a public Github repository at https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/UKFSR2024. It is crucial that the content code for graphics and related output is captured here.

This is the most effective way to create the content in a multiuser environment, but eventually the content needs to be converted for publication on GOV.UK. This process, as with preparing for the physical print (Section 7) has a resource and time overhead. Factor in prep for web time! (ideally 1 week) and lock the text The text must be converted to Govspeak, a flavour of Markdown. Graphics must be saved as separate files and uploaded to the publishing system. CSV files of data must also be prepared. Web publishing for statistics is handled by a small number of people who are accredited to use Whitehall Publisher. We are fortunate to have two publishers in the food team. But there is an overhead. web team to commandeer additional resource to cover second-eyes etc process during web print conversion 6.2 Graphics PNG images must be 960 pixels wide by 640 pixels high at 72 dpi. SVGs can be any size and do not need resizing before uploading. 6.3 Converting Word documents to markdown R code for library(rmarkdown) pandoc_convert(input = &#39;FILENAME.docx&#39;, to=&quot;markdown_mmd&quot;, output = &quot;FILENAME.md&quot;, options = c(&quot;--wrap=none&quot;, &quot;--reference-links&quot;, &quot;--extract-media=./images/&quot;)) this process will extract the graphics (be they PNG or SVG format) from each Word document and place them in a separately created /images/media folder as .png files, leaving behind just a placeholder for the graphic in the text, e.g.  &lt;img src=&quot;./images/media/image1.png&quot; style=&quot;width:6.69375in;height:2.75347in&quot; /&gt; 6.4 Logistics This should ideally be executed by the analytical lead for each theme: Once the Word documents have been converted to a .md Markdown text format, the user should firstly check that all Word formatting (headings, etc.) has fed through correctly by highlighting text in the text file and pasting into the box within the Govspeak converter and preview page and viewing the output on the page. Graphics handling: after Word document conversion, directly below the graphic title, replace the abovementioned placeholder with a descriptor (within square brackets) containing the graphic filename (with the correct nomenclature) with a ‘.svg’ suffix, i.e. [Image: tX_s_nv_description.svg] (where X is theme number, s is section number, n is indicator number, v is indicator variant, e.g. a,b,c, etc., description is content descriptor), leaving a blank line before and after. The SVG files will have been generated using the relevant R code by each analyst and saved in the Amazon S3 bucket. Adoption of this procedure will then correctly synchronise the eventually uploaded, finalised, .md Markdown files with the Whitehall publishing system, the publisher landing page for the report automatically displaying all graphics on the page after the bulk upload of all SVG files performed by the onduty publisher. The publisher will then insert the tX_s_nv_description.svg SVG filenames manually into the prompt box underneath each graphic on the Whitehall GOV.UK Publisher landing page so as to match the SVG file nomenclature in the [Image: tX_s_nv_description.svg] line. For the situation of tables allowing for the switching between bar chart and table/accessible view, this involves a simple option entered below the formatted table, e.g. **Figure 5.1.4c:** FSS breakdown of incidents by category between 2015 to 2016 and 2020 to 2021 | **Category** | **FYE 2016** | **FYE 2017** | **FYE 2018** | **FYE 2019** | **FYE 2020** | **FYE 2021** | |--------------------------------------------|------------:|------------:|------------:|------------:|------------:|------------:| | Allergens | 11 | 8 | 21 | 20 | 18 | 13 | | Animal Feed | 5 | 3 | 7 | 9 | 4 | 4 | | Chemical | 5 | 1 | 14 | 8 | 10 | 17 | | Emergency | 4 | 9 | 11 | 6 | 4 | 2 | | Genetically Modified Organism / Novel Food | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 3 | 5 | | Illegal Activity | 10 | 5 | 1 | 1 | 3 | 6 | | Microbiological | 20 | 23 | 23 | 24 | 27 | 17 | | On-farm | 12 | 18 | 9 | 6 | 7 | 11 | | Other | 3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 1 | 0 | | Physical | 1 | 1 | 3 | 7 | 7 | 2 | | Production Error | 3 | 3 | 6 | 7 | 7 | 4 | | Regulatory Breach | 11 | 17 | 22 | 17 | 4 | 8 | | Shellfish[^9] | 66 | 15 | 15 | 3 | 3 | 5 | | **Total** | **152** | **104** | **134** | **112** | **98** | **94** | {barchart} where {barchart} refers to a simple bar chart (multiple columns will display as grouped bars), alternatively use {barchart stacked} for a stacked bar chart (the final column is used to display the total), use {barchart compact} for a compact bar chart (this saves space by shrinking the chart), use {barchart negative} if there are negative data values. For combining different styles of bar chart, use more than one tag on separate lines. For example, to create a compact negative chart add: {barchart negative} {barchart compact} Check each graphic has an appropriate line covering accessibility considerations (i.e. the so-called ‘alt-text’) directly below each graphic title and its data source and before the links for viewing and downloading pertinent CSV file data, e.g. Figure XX.X description: ‘Figure XX.X is a line chart that shows the amount of consumer spending in the UK on food and non-alcoholic drink, alcoholic drink (off-licence only) and for catering from 2002 to 2022’. In essence this sentence is an expansion (if necessary) of the graphic title itself. ODS files: Each theme has its own dedicated link within the landing page. It will also have a bespoke download link for a specific, accessible, ODS file containing all CSV file entries in separate, formatted, worksheet tabs (the tabs being named with the filename naming convention, see below). The formatting for each tab should essentially contain the usual contact details, etc. Within each theme text file (and underneath each graphic) there will be a placeholder for downloading the appropriate ODS file for that theme. The current standard GOV.UK nomenclature for downloading an ODS file is, e.g. [Download the data for this chart](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/NODE/tX_s_nv_description_DATE.ods) where X is theme number, s is section number, n is indicator number, v is indicator variant, e.g. a,b,c, etc., description is content descriptor, DATE is publication date, in the recommended format e.g. 01jan2024. It will be good practice to have this placeholder url placed directly underneath the accessibility text (as described above); the onduty publisher will insert the unique ‘node’ for each graphic file download url in the final publishing step before sending a preview page of the UKFSR report to the team or submitting the final version of the UKFSR report for 2i publishing approval. 6.5 Formatting To add external links to GOV.UK pages, use square brackets [] around the link text and round brackets () around the link URL, i.e.  [LINK TEXT](url) Make sure there are no spaces between the brackets or the link will not work. Alternatively (if appropriate), “square bracket entries” can exist in isolation, the main link appearing at the bottom of the text file, e.g. in the text file body: &#39;Further information on National Statistics can be found on the [Office for Statistics Regulation] website&#39; is augmented by &#39;[Office for Statistics Regulation]: https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/national-statistics/&#39; at the bottom of the text file. Likewise, for referal to offficial “tweets”, &#39;You can also contact us via Twitter: [@DefraStats]&#39; in the text file body is augmented by &#39;[@DefraStats]: https://twitter.com/defrastats&#39; at the bottom of the text file. This also permits the possibility of emphasising links by way of underlining, It fulfils a duty under [&lt;u&gt;Part 2, Chapter 1 (Section 19) of the Agriculture Act 2020&lt;/u&gt;] to prepare and lay before Parliament&#39; in the text file body is then augmented by &#39;[&lt;u&gt;Part 2, Chapter 1 (Section 19) of the Agriculture Act 2020&lt;/u&gt;]: https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2020/21/section/19/enacted&#39; at the bottom of the text file. When linking to any Whitehall content, use the Whitehall publisher link and not the website URL. The first part of the URL https://whitehall-admin.publishing.service.gov.uk/ should be used along with the relative path, for example: /government/admin/publications/123456 (i.e. use relative links). For internal document links, i.e. for providing Markdown links to particular section headings in a publication page (known as ‘anchor’ links, which although, by definition, present accessibility issues, in a report of this complexity are unavoidable), in order to link to a particular section, e.g. ‘SECTION NAME’, the following should be added to the text file, including a ‘stub name’ that uniquely identifies a particular section: **[SECTION NAME](#STUBNAME)** this will appear in bold font as the clickable ‘SECTION NAME’ in the publication webpage text; the corresponding url being: https://www.gov.uk/......#STUBNAME Clicking the link will take the reader to the part of the webpage signified in the text file by: ### SECTION NAME {:#STUBNAME} &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; i.e. {:#STUBNAME} has to go on a new line, this is then followed by two blank line &lt;br/&gt; HTML codes. For example, in a text file: ‘as outlined further in [Indicator 1.2.2] (#united-kingdom-food-security-report-2021-theme1-indicator-1-2-2)’ appears as ‘as outlined further in [Indicator 1.2.2](#united-kingdom-food-security-report-2021-theme1-indicator-1-2-2)’ in the webpage text. Clicking the link in the latter sends the reader to: ‘Indicator 1.2.2 Components of global food demand growth’ theme section in the publication webpage, which is also indicated on the left hand side section menu window pane of the latter. The relevant part of the text file should appear in the form: ## Indicator 1.2.2 Components of global food demand growth {:#united-kingdom-food-security-report-2021-theme1-indicator-1-2-2} &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; The equivalent guidance for graphics (should the option for linking to them directly from the text be desirable) is to have the stub directly after the graphic name, e.g. [Figure 2.1](#Figure-2-1) for both simple graphics as well as graphics that allow for the switching between bar chart and table/accessible views and then put the reference {:#Figure-2-1} directly underneath the graphic title, i.e. ### Figure 2.1 TITLE {:#Figure-2-1} It is also possible to have subsections referred to with the same stub name such that clicking the visible link takes the reader to the main section where they can find the relevant subsection below this, e.g. to define the term ‘Gross Value Added’ under the ‘Glossary’ section heading in the ‘Total Factor Productivity of the United Kingdom Food Chain’ publication page Total Factor Productivity of the United Kingdom Food Chain, the entry ‘In 2021, the value of [Gross Value Added] (#tfp-glossary)’ in the text file is observed on the webpage as ‘In 2021, the value of Gross Value Added’ (the underline here referring to the clickable link), such that ‘### Gross Value Added (GVA)’ appears as its own subsection heading within the glossary, ## Glossary {:#tfp-glossary} ....... ....... ....... ### Gross Value Added (GVA) For linking to other themes/sections in the report GOV.UK landing page, it is just a case of adding the stub to the end of the url for the report landing page (in this case the name of the stub will be generated by the publishing system and the publishing team will have sight of this; the full url can then be added to the relevant text file before final submission in much the same way as adding CSV file details), e.g. switch to Theme 2 from Theme 1 [Theme 2: UK Food Supply Sources](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/united-kingdom-food-security-report-2021/united-kingdom-food-security-report-2021-theme-2-uk-food-supply-sources) switch to the Table of Contents [Theme 2: UK Food Supply Sources](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/united-kingdom-food-security-report-2021/united-kingdom-food-security-report-2021-contents) switch to the Appendix [Appendix](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/united-kingdom-food-security-report-2021/united-kingdom-food-security-report-2021-appendix) switch to the landing page [Return to the United Kingdom Food Security 2021 home page]https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/united-kingdom-food-security-report-2021 examples of indicator and Case Study links: [Indicator 1.1.1 Global output per capita](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/united-kingdom-food-security-report-2021/united-kingdom-food-security-report-2021-theme-1-global-food-availability#united-kingdom-food-security-report-2021-theme1-indicator-1-1-1) [Case study 1.1 Plant diseases and pests](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/united-kingdom-food-security-report-2021/united-kingdom-food-security-report-2021-theme-1-global-food-availability#united-kingdom-food-security-report-2021-theme1-case_study-1-1) This is a particularly useful feature as the use of stubs in this way will lead a reader straight to an indicator/Case Study section in the relevant published Theme page. Stub names can also be used with external links to other GOV.UK publications cited within the report. They can be formatted by adding ‘#’ and the stub name to the external url, with all words separated by hyphens.

For UKFSR2021 the printers needed a PDF of the final document to turn into the final laid report. Factor in print publication time! (ideally 1 week) and lock the text Do not forget that preparing for web publishing (Section 6) is a separate and different process that also requires time and resources. 7.1 Final Word version The assumption is that the final version will be contained in multiple Word files: one for each theme plus introductions, appendices, glossary, etc. Once these are finalised a master print version can be produced. ‘Lock’ the content: set a deadline and get everyone out of the Sharepoint documents copy the final section docs into a new folder: this folder is the master print content get a copy of the Defra doc template which has a default front and back cover check and secure an ISBN/Defra document number check any standard copyright notice text check other cover/back cover/inside cover text: last time there was specific wording like ‘laid before the HoC Library on date’ that needed to conform with protocol. With this cover sheet insert the section docs as ‘subdocuments’, in outline view. This allows the building of the master table of contents which covers the whole report. Insert the TOC and set up the Contents pages. Once all the content is in place, we can turn to formatting for print: Margins: each section of the report needs to be formatted with mirror margins so that there is a larger gutter where the binding will be. Otherwise the content will get lost in the printed doc. Page numbering: inside and outside so that they appear on the right and left hand side of the printed page. You need to set page numbers to inherit from each previous section so that they flow from 1-n and don’t reset at the start of each child doc. Pagination: this was a bit of a fiddle last time. Make sure that the content is settled (You probably want to eyeball the content for any errors with heading levels etc and fix all content snags before doing this or else you’ll have to do it again). Refresh the TOC, and then go through inserting white space where necessary to ensure page breaks don’t occur in unfortunate places. URLs: We dont need to worry about URLs working in a paper document, but in a PDF we might want clickable links. This is pretty irrelevant to the final HTML publication (remember: the HTML is the publication, not some paper document!). Focus on maximising hyperlinks in the we b publication. At this point the document should be ready for PDF conversion. 7.2 Create PDF At this point it should be easy: export the master Word doc to PDF (PDF/A I think: check!). Worth checking accessibility even though the HTML version will be the truly accessible version. One thing worth checking: metadata. Check the author, organisation etc metadata in the word doc is what you want in the PDF version. 7.3 Accessibility There was an unfulfilled request for a large print version last time. With a bit of luck, any MPs with such requirements will accept the HTML version as accessible, zoomable and screen reader friendly. If not, repeat the document conversion process and edit the style definitions to up the font size. I think there might be practical printing issues which mean it would have to be printed as multiple documents. UKFSR at 300 odd pages I think was approaching the limit of what perfect binding print can handle. Speak to the print supplier about these issues.

A.3 General legal guidance from 2024 A.4 Publication deadline [from legal comments 11/01/2024] The date you should lay the report is actually 3 years from the date of the last report so that would be the 15 December 2024 (although note that this is a Sunday so the last sitting day before this date would be appropriate). There is no reason not to publish before this date if needed and it would be advisable not to leave it to the last possible date. Section 19 of the Agriculture Act 2020 states that a new UKFSR is required “at least once every three years”. We think that the safest way to interpret this would be that each UKFSR laying starts a three-year ‘clock’ by which another UKFSR must be published. As the first UKFSR was laid in Parliament on December 16 2021, the three-year clock means that the next must be laid by December 15 2024, but can be any time before. If UKFSR2 is instead laid on, for instance, September 1 2024, UKFSR3 will have to be laid by August 31 2027. Also please note that although preferable, Parliament does not absolutely have to be sitting for a paper to be laid. This has previously been considered by policy and legal and whilst the UKFSR was published as an Act paper, if it must be published on a non-sitting day in order to avoid breaching statutory duties, Parliamentary Team consider that it could in exceptional circumstances be laid as a Command Paper with the full knowledge of the Journal Office and with the relevant changes made to its cover. This may not be necessary in future but for now it is advisable. Further, the UKFSR is Official Statistics, which require notice of publication at least four weeks before the intended publication date, and publication on that date. Once the date is pre-notified, any failure to publish on that date will invite scrutiny from the Office of Statistical Regulation. This does not touch on any of the other rules, but if coming out on the same day should take account of the time it takes to lay documents in Parliament, so the next UKFSR should probably commit to publish at noon or so rather than 0930. A.4.1 Late laying of the report If the report is laid later than deadline date there would be a breach of this statutory duty. The risk of a legal challenge being brought (our assessment is that there would be a low risk (less than 30%)) would depend on the circumstances that caused the delay and the length of the delay. However, if it is brought the chances of successful challenge are medium-high (50-70%) given that there is a clear statutory duty to publish by a certain date. We could perhaps mitigate this depending on the circumstances which would lower the risk. For example, the Courts would likely look more favourably on SoS if the reason for delay was an election. However, if you know there will be an election then steps should be taken to avoid delay as much as possible. In short, unavoidable circumstances would look more favourable to the Courts than avoidable ones. A.4.2 Environmental principles policy We have considered whether the Environmental principles policy would apply here. Section 17(5) of the Environment Act 2021 sets out 5 principles that ministers will need to consider when making policy, namely: integration principle prevention principle rectification at source principle polluter pays principle precautionary principle Whilst any particular concerns arising from considerations in the EPP statement will likely not apply when collecting data and compiling the report, any policy development that follows on from the reports’ findings should have due regard to the principles. This is just something to flag at this stage. A.4.3 General considerations Lastly, and as a general legal point, if the contents of the report were to be challenged, the ground would likely be rationality. It is therefore important that information sources are referenced correctly and checked. The 2021 report will of course provide an excellent starting point and seeing as that was not challenged, adopting a similar approach would be sensible.
