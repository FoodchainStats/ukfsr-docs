[["data.html", "Section 4 Data guide 4.1 Format 4.2 Storage", " Section 4 Data guide How we prepare and organise data. 4.1 Format The data underlying each chart needs to be stored in csv format. This is so we can offer a preview link for the data alongside each chart. GDS Transport font!! 4.2 Storage Raw data is stored in the Amazon S3 bucket s3-ranch-054. Storage is certified for sensitive data (although most data should be public domain). 4.2.1 Access The bucket is accessible from across Defra (?) library(aws.s3) contents &lt;- get_bucket_df(&quot;s3-ranch-054&quot;) x &lt;- aws.s3::s3read_using(FUN = readr::read_csv, bucket = &quot;s3-ranch-054&quot;, object = &quot;example.csv&quot;) 4.2.2 Structure Here is the current suggested structure for the S3 bucket folders: Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 4 Comments theme_X Top level TX_s_n Indicator section and number (include description?) data Raw data in any form can be stored here. output graphics Contains png and svg final graphic files csv Contains final csv required to reproduce the graphics in R. In tidy format. misc Optional folder to store random files, eg map shapefiles. 4.2.3 File naming convention UKFSR content files must adhere to a naming convention. Supplementary files such as raw data etc can be more fluid, although we recommend includint theme/ indicator numbers. If in doubt, err on the side of long descriptive file names - its 3 years befoer anyone will look at these again! Content filename template TX_s_n_v_description.svg/png/csv where: X is theme number s is section number n is indicator number v is indicator variant, eg a,b,c, etc description needs to be enough to uniquely describe the content. Use snake_case as necessary. filetype must be csv for data, svg/png for web/print respectively 4.2.4 Code The S3 bucket is not a public resource (although generally its contents need not be stored securely). But the code to produce the content is stored in a public Github repository at https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/UKFSR2024. It is crucial that the content code for graphics and related output is captured here.
