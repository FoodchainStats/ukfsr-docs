For the text styleguide, see Section 2. There is general guidance on chart design produced by the Analysis Function. Please refer to Section 4 on preparing data for charting and publication as preview csv data. 3.1 Colours The UKFSR uses the Analysis Function palette as recommended here. There is an R package, afcolours available on CRAN, which helps with implementing the palette. There are a maximum of 6 colours available in the palette for categorical variables. This means that an individual chart may not have more than 6 series. 3.2 Chart context Each chart is accompanied by some additional features: CSV: the csv of the chart data is required for a preview/download link URL to source: the default is a link to collection pages wherever possible. 3.3 Resolution/format Graphics must be saved in both SVG and PNG format, as required by gov.uk and for PDF respectively. See Section 6 for more details. 3.4 Helpers The ukfsr package contains functions to assist with preparing the report. See [link to repo/docs] for details. There is a theme_ukfsr theme for chart styling, plus some functions to assist with saving charts and data in the S3 bucket. Defaults like linewidth = 1.5 for series need to be specified?
