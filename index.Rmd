# About

This is an experimental site for documentation and guidance relating to
producing the UKFSR. Its intended audience is mainly the production team,
present and future. The source is
[here](https://github.com/FoodchainStats/ukfsr-docs). Got suggestions for things
to add/change? You can go [here](https://github.com/FoodchainStats/ukfsr-docs/issues),
open a new issue and submit your comments.


## What is this and how do I use it?

The plan is to capture everything related to UKFSR2024 production based on
lessons from UKFSR2021 which might be useful, and end up with a repository to
pick up again once UKFSR2027 is being planned.

The guidance covers the mechanics of preparing text and graphical content,
preparing for print, organisation of data and files, etc. Editorial decisions
about content to inclide are out of scope. We aim for a logical structure, but
there may be some nuggets dropped in unusual places. At the moment its a brain
dump!

**Rationale**

We are working in the open as much as we can, so this is not a Defra Sharepoint
repository but a public Github one. We know that this means its not quite so
accessible for policy professionals to edit, but we will work on this. Working
in the open doesn't mean that we are not allowed to have internal conversations.
We don't put anything in here that we are not prepared to make public - its for
future teams, to make sure we've captured all the useful info to make their
lives easier. If there are sensitive messages/lessons, we store them somewhere
else.

This approach mirrors our approach to data and the production process: we are
storing the relevant code we use to wrangle data and produce graphics in a
similar repository. Data that is not open will of course not be shared.

Being as open and reproducible as we can is one of the current ambitions for
official statistics production. This site is part of our way of trying to meet
that ambition. That does not mean we will not make necessary internal decisions
as needed - those will be recorded appropriately and documented safely
for future reference elsewhere.


## UKFSR Infrastructure

The UKFSR is more than just a single document. It has a number of components as
part of its underlying infrastructure:

- The text content (probably drafted and hosted on Sharepoint during production)
- The underlying data and graphics content, hosted on an Amazon S3 bucket
- The [code](https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/UKFSR2024) to produce the graphics and data for preview
- The [`ukfsr`](https://github.com/FoodchainStats/ukfsr) R package containing miscellaneous helper functions
- This documentation

All of this content is combined to produce *two* key outputs:

- the report on [gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/united-kingdom-food-security-report) (this is the UKFSR to all intents and purposes for the public)
- the physical printed edition laid in the HoC Library (important, but a limited print run and inaccessible to all except MPs)

In addition, there may be other published outputs, such as condensed reports,
technical annexes etc, depending on individual feedback.


## Accessibility

It is a legal obligation to make sure that our content is accessible, and this
applies to written content, graphics and tables. Text cintent guidance is in
Section \@ref(text).For chart design guidance, see Section \@ref(chart).


## Timings, resources and pinch points

The project plan is outside of the scope of this guide. However it is worth
noting some salient features of the process.

- **Data cutoff:** With a diverse set of data sources and a wide ranging release calendar, it may not be possible to match the drafting process to the release of the latest data. In some cases content can be drafted with the data available at the time and updated once the latest is published. This will apply most to annual releases. In others, for example inflation, data is more frequent. In all cases, essentially a decision has to be taken on the point at which no new data will be included, and the text finalised to cover the latest data at that point.

- **Content lock:** It may be an obvious point, but there needs to be a point at which the content is set and no further amendments can be made, to allow the publishing process to start. It may be a naive hope, but this needs time. And locking content means finalising SoS input etc. Web publishing is a specialist role, and there are a limited number of people who can set publications up on Whitehall Publisher. **This is a pinch point with little remediation**.
